Gender and Age Prediction Project
📌 Overview
This project is designed to predict gender and age from given input data using machine learning algorithms. The objective is to build a reliable system for demographic classification.

🛠️ Features
Predicts gender and age based on input features.
Machine learning model with high accuracy and scalability.
Easy-to-use API/command-line interface for prediction.
📁 Project Structure
data/: Dataset files used for training and testing.
models/: Pre-trained models or scripts for model saving/loading.
scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and predictions.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.
README.md: Documentation of the project (this file).
